# AI Project: Prisoner's Dilemma

## Abstract

This project simulates the Prisoner's Dilemma, a pivotal concept in game theory, where two rational players face a dilemma: whether to cooperate or defect.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore strategic decision-making in competitive environments through the simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma. By employing reinforcement learning techniques, the project aims to analyze how AI agents adapt and strategize in repeated interactions, shedding light on the balance between individual rationality and collective outcomes.

## Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma

In the classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario, two suspects are arrested and face the dilemma of cooperating (remaining silent) or defecting (confessing) during interrogation. The outcomes vary based on the combination of their decisions: cooperation leads to a collectively favorable outcome, while defection can result in individually beneficial but collectively detrimental consequences. This dilemma illustrates the complex interplay between self-interest and cooperation in strategic interactions.

## Project Overview

The project employs various AI methodologies, including Q-learning and predefined strategies like tit-for-tat and grudge-holding, to model agent behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma. By simulating numerous iterations of the dilemma, the project tracks the learning progress of AI agents and visualizes cooperation dynamics. Furthermore, testing against predefined strategies assesses the agents' competitiveness and adaptability, offering insights into their decision-making processes.

## Key Contributions

- Utilization of reinforcement learning techniques to model strategic decision-making in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
- Exploration of AI approaches, including Q-learning and predefined strategies, to analyze agent behavior.
- Visualization of learning progress and cooperation dynamics to understand the evolution of AI strategies.
- Evaluation of AI competitiveness and adaptability through testing against predefined strategies.
- Insights into the intricate balance between individual rationality and collective outcomes in strategic interactions, as exemplified by the Prisoner's Dilemma.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of strategic decision-making and cooperative behavior, as demonstrated by the Prisoner's Dilemma. By leveraging AI techniques, the project enhances our understanding of how agents adapt and strategize in competitive environments, highlighting the importance of collective outcomes in shaping individual behavior.
